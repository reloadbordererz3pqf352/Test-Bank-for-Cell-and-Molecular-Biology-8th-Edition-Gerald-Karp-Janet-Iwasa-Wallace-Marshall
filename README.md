Author:  Gerald Karp, Janet Iwasa, Wallace Marshall

Designed for courses in Cell Biology offered at the Sophomore/Junior level, Karp's Cell and Molecular Biology continues to be the best book in the market at connecting key concepts to the experiments that reveal how we know what we know in the world of Cell Biology. This classic text explores core concepts in considerable depth, often adding experimental detail. It is written in an inviting style and at mid-length, to assist students in managing the plethora of details encountered in the Cell Biology course.  In this edition, two new co-authors take the helm and help to expand upon the hallmark strengths of the book, update and integrate text and media in a useful way, improving the student learning experience.
